A food hub website is an online platform that connects consumers with local food producers, suppliers, and artisans.
It serves as a centralized hub where people can discover, purchase, and learn about locally sourced food products.
These websites typically offer a variety of features such as:
1. Product Listings: Displaying a range of locally produced food items including fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, baked goods, and more.
2. Vendor Profiles: Providing information about the farmers, ranchers, chefs, and other food producers participating in the platform, including
   their background, farming practices, and products.
3. Online Marketplace: Allowing users to browse and purchase items directly from local producers, often with options for delivery or pickup.
